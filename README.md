# International Telecom Week Project Analysis

This project was conducted for International Telecom Week on behalf of a telecom company. It provided valuable insights and actionable strategies to optimize costs and enhance decision-making.

## âœ… Project Objective:
The objective was to analyze traffic data terminated from the UAE to the world, identify cost-efficient telecom service providers, and explore negotiation opportunities to maximize profitability.

## ðŸ“Š Key Analysis Breakdown:
1. **Descriptive Analysis**: Calculated the total cost per minute offered by each company across regions to assess their pricing structures.
2. **Diagnostic Analysis**: Identified the minimum cost for each region and the company offering that rate.
3. **Predictive Analysis**: Predicted that if prices were reduced by 1% of the minimum cost, annual savings of $3.29M could be achieved. Additionally, determined for each region what percentage reduction the other two companies would need to achieve a price 1% lower than the minimum cost offered by the leading company.
4. **Prescriptive Analysis**: Established actionable criteria for negotiationsâ€”regions where companies need to reduce costs by â‰¤20% to meet 1% less than the minimum price were flagged for negotiations. If these negotiations are successfully executed as per recommendations, an additional $1.1M in savings can be achieved annually.

## ðŸ“Œ Recommendations:
- **Regions to be assigned to Telstra**: Major regions including Australia & New Zealand, Asia, Europe, and Africa.
- **Regions to be assigned to TATA**: Melanesia, Middle Africa, Polynesia, Southern Africa, and Eastern Europe.
- **Regions to be assigned to France Telecom**: Micronesia and satellite communication regions.

### Negotiation Opportunities:
Opportunities are available for Central America, Central Asia, Eastern Africa, South-Eastern Asia, and Eastern Europe, primarily with TATA and France Telecom. Additionally, Belgacom offers limited coverage. Expanding their reach and updating their pricing could position them as a competitive option in the future.

The analysis delivered actionable insights for cost optimization, including clear recommendations on telecom traffic allocation and targeted negotiations.
